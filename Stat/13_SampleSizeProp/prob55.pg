    A computer specialist inspected 150 PCs on campus and found that $phat% of them needed upgraded.  Of interest is the population proportion of PCs that need upgraded. What size sample would produce a margin of error of 3% based on a $level% confidence interval?
        $BR$BR

        Answer: \{ ans_rule(8) \} (Round up to the next whole number.)
